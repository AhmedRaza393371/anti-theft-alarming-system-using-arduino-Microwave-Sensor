Applications:
An anti-theft system using Arduino, LCD, and a buzzer has a range of applications where security, monitoring, and alerting are essential.
Here are some potential applications for such a system:
Home Security System: The system can be used to secure homes by detecting unauthorized entry or motion in sensitive areas. When motion is detected, the LCD can display a warning message, and the buzzer can sound an alarm, alerting homeowners and deterring intruders.

Vehicle Security: The anti-theft system can protect vehicles from theft or unauthorized access. If someone tries to break into a vehicle, the system can trigger the buzzer and display a message on the LCD to alert the owner.

Office Security: The system can be employed to safeguard office spaces during non-working hours. Any movement in restricted areas can trigger the alarm and notify security personnel.
